# hello-react

This project my assignment for Module 4:

- Go to the [guide](https://io.tskoli.dev/guides/5f1335b8b279dc27c467cae5)
- Go to the [live demo](https://tristan-sch.github.io/hello-react/)

## What did I do?

I created a simple Weather App. For this I used these APIs:

- [getAvailableStations](https://apis.is/weather/getAvailableStations)
- [observations](https://apis.is/weather/observations/en?stations=1)

### `Here are the steps I followed:`

1. Choosing the station/city with a select dropdown
2. Passing the id of the selected city into the "observations" API like so `http://apis.is/weather/observations/en?stations=${id}`
3. Displaying some of the data from the API

## Notes

- I had trouble passing the ID of the selected city into the "observations" API and asked SmÃ¡ri for help
- I'm using 2 different mehtods to fetch the APIs -> with Axios and with FETCH
- I realise that I should be using hooks instead of Class Components
- I did not put any effort into styling
